# Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

## Background Information

Tonight we'll cover *Common Table Expressions* (CTE) and how to use it as an alternative to subqueries.

### What is a CTE?

A Common Table Expression (CTE) is a temporary result set that can be referred to within a subsequent SQL statement. CTEs are often used to enhance the readability of complex SQL queries, offering a clearer alternative to nested subqueries.

CTEs are defined using a WITH clause followed by an SQL statement. They can be utilized in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements. The result set generated by a CTE is transient and only accessible during the runtime of the query.


Basic Syntax WITH query is as follows where *name_for_summary_data* is the name given to the WITH clause result set.
```sql
WITH
   name_for_summary_data AS (SELECT Statement)
   SELECT columns
   FROM name_for_summary_data
   WHERE conditions <=> (
      SELECT column
      FROM name_for_summary_data)
   [ORDER BY columns]
```

### Example: Cars That Need Service

Here is an example of how you can use a CTE to break down what might be a very long and hard to read query into two parts to increase readability.

Let's imagine that the manager of service at a dealership wants to see which cars haven't been in for a oil change recently. He wants to send a reminder to the owners of those vehicles.

#### Setup

First, insert some oil change records into the database.

```sql
insert into oilchangelogs
	(date_occured, vehicle_id)
values
	('2020-01-09', 1),
	('2021-10-30', 2),
	('2019-02-20', 3),
	('2022-03-17', 4)
;
```

#### First Solution

First, you can create a CTE to get cars that require an oil change service.

```sql
with vehicles_needing_service as
(
	select
		v.vehicle_id,
		v.year_of_car,
		v.miles_count,
		TO_CHAR(o.date_occured, 'YYYY-MM-DD') date_of_last_change
	from vehicles v

	join oilchangelogs o
		on v.vehicle_id = o.vehicle_id
	where o.date_occured < '2022-01-01'
)
```

Once that is defined, you can now query that set of results as part of a larger query to get all of the information needed.

```sql
select
	vs.vehicle_id,
	vs.miles_count,
	s.purchase_date,
	e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name seller,
	c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name purchaser,
	c.email
from vehicles_needing_service vs -- Use the CTE
join sales s
	on s.vehicle_id  = vs.vehicle_id
join employees e
	on s.employee_id = e.employee_id
join customers c
	on s.customer_id = c.customer_id
order by
	vs.vehicle_id,
	s.purchase_date desc
;
```

This produces results that are _kinda_ what you want. Note: If you are running this in DBeaver, you will need to highlight the whole query and then run it.

#### Second Solution

Since multiple people can purchase the same car over time, the service manager only wants the last purchaser. You can break this part of the SQL out into another CTE. You can use multiple CTEs as part of the query. You separate them with a comma.

```sql
with vehicles_needing_service as
(
	select
		v.vehicle_id,
		v.year_of_car,
		v.miles_count,
		TO_CHAR(o.date_occured, 'YYYY-MM-DD') date_of_last_change
	from vehicles v

	join oilchangelogs o
		on v.vehicle_id = o.vehicle_id
	where o.date_occured < '2022-01-01'
),
last_purchase as (
	select
		s.vehicle_id,
		max(s.purchase_date) purchased
	from sales s
	group by s.vehicle_id
)
```

Now you have another CTE that can be used to filter down the results to get the info about the last purchase only.

```sql
select
	vs.vehicle_id,       -- Get vehicle id from first CTE
	vs.miles_count,      -- Get miles from first CTE
	lp.purchased,        -- Get purchase date from second CTE
	e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name seller,
	c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name purchaser,
	c.email
from vehicles_needing_service vs
join last_purchase lp   -- Join the second CTE
	on lp.vehicle_id  = vs.vehicle_id
join sales s
	on lp.vehicle_id = s.vehicle_id
	and lp.purchased = s.purchase_date
join employees e
	on s.employee_id = e.employee_id
join customers c
	on s.customer_id = c.customer_id
;
```

| id|miles_count|purchase_date|seller|purchaser|email|

## Practice

* For the top 5 dealerships, provide a list of vehicle models and the number of that model sold for the specific dealership. The results should be  ordered by the dealership and within the dealership, the number of vehicles sold for a given model from most to least.
* Write a query that lists the top 5 dealerships.  Include a column that indicates whether there were more sales or leases for that dealership.
* For all used cars, provide a query that returns the state the car was sold in and the number of sales.
	* Modify the query to return the 5 best states (sold the most).
 	* Modify the query again to return the 5 worst states (sold the least).
* For all used cars, write a query that returns the Make and the number of that make that are in the current inventory.
	* Expand that query to include the model and the number of each model in the current inventory.
 	* Use this query to answer which model has the most cars in the inventory and which make has the most cars in the inventory.
