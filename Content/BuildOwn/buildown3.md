# Jake's Farms: Build the Database

Take the skills you learned in part 3 along with the ERD you created in part 2 to write a script that will create Jake's Database.  **Tip**: The order of SQL statements in the script matters.  

**Pause to think**: Why would a script to create the data structure be more valuable than just using the GUI to create what you need?

Next, the database is going to need Jake's data INSERTED into it.  Jake, proud of his technical skills, provided you with some `.csv` files he made from the companies Excel sheets.  These files contain all the data the company currently has.  

**Challenge**: the provided data may not be structured how your database is.  How do you get the data inserted?
