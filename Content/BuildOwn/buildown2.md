# Jake's Farms ERD

We here at Jakes Farm's are looking to expand our business to multiple different stores! With this major overhaul of our business, we realize the need for proper data management. We require a database developer to create a reliable source of data management for our company.


The database must:


1) Keep track of every stores individual inventory 


2) Keep track of every stores current manager 


3) Keep track of every stores staff members 


4) Keep track of every sale and which staff member makes the sale.

Create an ERD that will accomplish the above criteria.  Think through what entities you need and what properties need to be on each entity.  Once complete, share your ERD with your instructors and other students.  How do their's compare to yours?  Are there any changes you made after consulting others?
