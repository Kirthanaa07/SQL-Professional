## Concurrency Control

Concurrency Control is a vital aspect of database management systems (DBMS), ensuring that when multiple transactions are executed simultaneously, they do not interfere with each other. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and consistency of data within the database.

The core purpose of concurrency control is to handle transactions in such a way that even when they access the same data concurrently, data consistency and integrity are upheld. This process is essential for transaction management, which involves ensuring that each transaction is atomic (all operations within the transaction are completed successfully, or none are), and durable (once committed, the transaction's changes are permanent).

One of the key goals of concurrency control is Serializability. It ensures that the execution of concurrent transactions produces the same outcome as if they were executed in a serial manner, one after another, thereby maintaining database consistency and data integrity.

Different types of concurrency control mechanisms are employed in DBMS:

1. Locking Mechanism: This involves acquiring locks on data items before any modifications. Locks can be either shared (allowing multiple transactions to read a data item) or exclusive (only one transaction can modify a data item at a time).

2. Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC): In this approach, transactions proceed without acquiring locks and only check for conflicts at the time of commit. If conflicts are detected, the transaction is aborted and restarted. This method is efficient when transaction aborts are rare.

3. Timestamp Ordering: Transactions are assigned unique timestamps, and they are executed in this order. Conflicts are resolved by aborting transactions with lower timestamps.

4. Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC): This increases performance by creating new versions of a database object each time it is written, allowing multiple versions to be accessed depending on the scheduling method.

In distributed DBMS, concurrency control becomes even more crucial due to transactions occurring across multiple sites. Lock-based and optimistic concurrency control protocols are commonly used in such environments to maintain database consistency and integrity.

Without proper concurrency control, various problems can arise, such as lost updates, dirty reads, inconsistent retrievals, and deadlocks. These issues can lead to data corruption and inconsistencies, making concurrency control an indispensable part of reliable and efficient database managementâ€‹
