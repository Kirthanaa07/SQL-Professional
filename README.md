# Purpose of Course

This course is designed for people who have minimal to beginner knowledge of the SQL language. Perhaps you've dabbled with SQL in an online course, taken a bootcamp course in web development, or learned on the job by building some simple business reports.

In this course, you will learn the breadth of the core features on a relational database management system (RDBMS) with which you can unlock more powerful outcomes from your data, or if you are professional developer, learn to make your applications more efficient.

The depth of exploration is limited, as this course is more about exposure to the concepts so that you can go back to your job and apply the skills to begin your journey to mastery.

The structure of the course is designed to cover specific topics in each class.  In class, we will learn the concept(s) being covered, practice using those skills, discuss problems with classmates and work as a whole class to solidify what was covered.  Each topic will be covered in depth enough to continue to the next topic.  There are optional resources and practice to dive even deeper on your own time if you like.  Example class schedule:

- 6-6:15: Check in and opening announcements
- 6:15-7: Work on the assignments for the night on your own
- 7-8: Work in groups to finish the individual problems and/or work the next level problems.  
- 8-9: Work as a class to answer questions, work problems and discuss the topic at hand.
